##Introduction and Overview
[__Python__](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language created by Guido van Rossum during the late 1980's. Python is an easy to learn programming language which emphasizes code readability.
Its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than in languages such as C++ or Java. Furthermore it has efficient high-level data structures, which allow you to write complex operations in fewer statements than in C, Java. 
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. 
 
Python comes with a interactive shell which makes programming in python much easier.The Python interpreter can be invoked by just typing the command `python` in command line, and using python interactive interpreter makes it really easy to check Python commands.

The main features of python can me summarized as follows:

* It has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax which makes is easy to learn. Here is a comparison of Hello World in C and Python

__Hello world in C__  
  ```
  #include stdout
 
int main()
{
 std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
  ```
__Hello words in python__
  
  ```
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```  
* Python code supports the indentation model for code blocks instead of using braces, which makes the code more readable and visible to the eyes.
* Python has relatively fewer lines of code as compared to other programming languages like C, Java, which makes it less prone to issues, easier to debug, and more maintainable.
* Python offers a large and comprehensive standard library which makes programming much easier, as it provides the efficient solutions to solving  particular problems like pattern matching, searching etc.
* Python code is portable i.e. python code written on one platform like windows can run on other platforms like Unix, Mac OS etc.
* Python code is extendable i.e. we can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter, which allows our code to be more efficient.

##__Installation__

#NumPy

[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is an open source extension module for Python. It is the core library for scientific computing in Python. 
It adds support to Python for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Besides that it supplies a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 

###Arrays in NumPy

Arrays are the central component of the module NumPy. A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the __rank__ of the array; the __shape__ of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

Refer to the [NumPy Array Example](https://github.com/joed7/fose_python/blob/master/numpy_example.py) for Numpy Array Syntax.
